# Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Configuration
- **Neon PostgreSQL** successfully configured with connection strings
- Database migrations applied successfully
- RLS enabled on all tables (users, sessions, api_keys, audit_logs, rate_limits, webhook_events, email_queue, feature_flags, system_config)

### 2. RLS Policies Implementation
- Created `auth` schema with helper functions:
  - `auth.user_id()` - Gets current user ID from session
  - `auth.user_role()` - Gets current user role
  - `auth.is_admin()` - Checks if user is admin
  - `auth.is_support()` - Checks if user is support

### 3. RLS Policies Applied
Successfully applied policies for most tables:
- ✅ **users** - Full RLS policies working
- ✅ **sessions** - Full RLS policies working  
- ✅ **api_keys** - Full RLS policies working
- ✅ **audit_logs** - Full RLS policies working
- ✅ **rate_limits** - Full RLS policies working
- ✅ **webhook_events** - Full RLS policies working
- ⚠️ **email_queue** - RLS enabled but policies failed (SQL syntax issue with 'to' column)
- ⚠️ **feature_flags** - RLS enabled but policies failed
- ⚠️ **system_config** - RLS enabled but policies failed

### 4. Prisma Client with RLS Support
Created enhanced Prisma client (`prismaRLS`) with:
- `$withRLS(context, callback)` - Execute queries with user context
- `$asUser(userId)` - Execute as specific user
- `$asAdmin()` - Execute with admin privileges
- `$bypassRLS()` - Bypass RLS for admin operations
- Automatic context management using AsyncLocalStorage

### 5. Hono API Integration
- Created RLS middleware that:
  - Maps JWT authentication to database context
  - Sets user ID and role for each request
  - Provides `withRLSContext()` helper for routes
- Integrated with existing authentication middleware
- Admin-only middleware for privileged endpoints

### 6. API Routes Updated
- User routes now use RLS context
- Session management respects user boundaries
- API key operations properly scoped to users
- Admin routes with elevated privileges

### 7. Testing
- ✅ Database package builds successfully
- ✅ API package builds successfully
- ✅ RLS integration test passes:
  - Users can only see their own data
  - Admins can see all data
  - Support users have appropriate access
  - Context switching works correctly

## Current Status

### Working Features
1. **User Isolation**: Regular users can only access their own data
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for USER, ADMIN, SUPPORT, AGENT, DEVELOPER
3. **Session Management**: Users can only manage their own sessions
4. **API Key Security**: API keys are properly isolated per user
5. **Audit Trail**: Audit logs track all operations with user context
6. **Rate Limiting**: Per-user rate limits enforced at database level

### Known Issues
1. **Email Queue Policies**: SQL syntax error with 'to' column (reserved keyword)
2. **Feature Flags Policies**: Need to fix policy syntax
3. **System Config Policies**: Need to fix policy syntax

## Environment Configuration

### .env.local
```env
# Neon Database URLs
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_aRyLiEFXnD06@ep-wild-sky-a16j1y5r-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_aRyLiEFXnD06@ep-wild-sky-a16j1y5r.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Context Validation**: Always validate user context before operations
2. **SQL Injection Protection**: Use parameterized queries
3. **Role Validation**: Verify roles match expected values
4. **Bypass Protection**: Only use `bypassRLS` for system operations
5. **Audit Everything**: Log all security-relevant operations

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining RLS policies for email_queue, feature_flags, system_config
2. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
3. Implement service role for admin operations
4. Add monitoring for RLS policy violations
5. Document RLS patterns for team reference

## Usage Examples

### Client Code
```typescript
// Execute with user context
const userData = await prismaRLS.$withRLS(
  { userId: 'user-123', userRole: 'USER' },
  async () => {
    return prismaRLS.user.findMany();
  }
);

// Admin operations
const allUsers = await prismaRLS.$asAdmin(async () => {
  return prismaRLS.user.findMany();
});
```

### API Route
```typescript
app.get('/users/me', authMiddleware(), async (c) => {
  const user = await withRLSContext(c, async () => {
    return prismaRLS.user.findUnique({
      where: { id: c.get('userId') }
    });
  });
  return c.json(user);
});
```

## Conclusion

Row Level Security has been successfully implemented for the Computer Guys chatbot project. The system now enforces data isolation at the database level, providing an additional layer of security beyond application-level controls. Most tables have working RLS policies, with only minor issues remaining in three tables that don't affect core functionality.
